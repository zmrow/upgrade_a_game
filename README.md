# Upgrade a game!

This is the repository for the Code Fellows CS20 Upgrade a game assignment.  It is essentially the same game as before, but built using html/css/js rather than just js alerts,etc.

In this game, Marshawn Lynch ( a runningback) is given the ball for a last play against the 49ers.  Marshawn and Aldon Smith ( a linebacker for the Niners) are given stats, a play is run, and then the stats are changed randomly to simulate stumbling, getting hit, etc.  Unless Marshawn is tackled, the play continues.

This repo contains:
* index.html - html structure.
* style.css - CSS rules to style to doc (I need some real designer training)
* game.js - Javascript file for the game.
* README - ummm, this file. 
* fonts/ - directory with external fonts (not very happy with these either)
* field.jpg - football field pic for game page
