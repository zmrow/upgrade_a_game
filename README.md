# Upgrade a game!

This is the repository for the Code Fellows CS20 Upgrade a game assignment.  It is essentially the same game as before, but built using html/css/js rather than just js alerts,etc.

In this game, Marshawn Lynch ( a runningback) is given the ball for a last play against the 49ers.  Marshawn and Aldon Smith ( a linebacker for the Niners) are given stats, a play is run, and then the stats are changed randomly to simulate stumbling, getting hit, etc.  Unless Marshawn is tackled, the play continues.

This repo contains:
* race_game.html - html structure.
* README - ummm, this file.
